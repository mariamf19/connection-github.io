      <p>
          When I set out to make this video, I had no clue where this was headed, but inspiration struck out of nowhere, I saw a sign right outside our classroom that seemed perfect for my theme.
          It read, "The relationship between humans and non-humans." Immediately, I had this idea buzzing in my head about how we're all connected - not just to each other, but to everything around us.
          
          There's this part where I filmed a piano playing. It got me thinking about how music touches something in us that we can't quite put into words. Then I caught a clock ticking away, and it hit me how time is this invisible thread running through all our experiences.
          
          One of my favorite bits is when I filmed my friend petting a cat. It's such a small thing, but it shows how we connect with other creatures without even thinking about it. There's also this shot of the cat just chilling on a table, like it's part of our world but in its own little bubble too.
          
          I caught my friend taking a picture of some artwork, and it struck me as this very human thing - trying to hold onto moments that move us. Then there's this clip from a music video that really messes with your head about what's human and what isn't.
          
          I got some footage of me walking around campus, which might sound boring, but it shows how we're always moving through spaces, leaving our mark and being shaped by them too. 
          
          To wrap it up, I zoomed in on my desk on which i keep all my keepsakes. It's like a map of all the connections we make - with people, places, and things that stick with us.
          
          Looking back at all these clips, I realized how rich our lives are because of all these connections we make, often without even noticing. That's really what I wanted to show with this video - all those little threads that tie us to the world around us.</p>

      <p style = "margin-bottom: 50px;">Hey! Iâ€™m Mariam Fatima. I'm an Interactive Media student at NYUAD. This field fascinates me because it's all about blending technology and art in ways that make us see the world differently. I'm constantly amazed by how interactive experiences can bridge the gap between us and, well, everything else. Whether it's using VR to explore far-off ecosystems or creating interactions that reveal the threads that tie us all together. This interest drives my creative and academic work, as I seek to uncover new ways to engage with the world through media.</p>
